BetterCharacterStats Classic
============================

This is a fork of the original BetterCharacterStats created by yutsuku for Vanilla WoW. I've modified it to support Classic.

Installation:

Put "BetterCharacterStats" folder into ".../World of Warcraft/\_classic\_/Interface/AddOns/".

Features:
- Displays character statistics in one place (just like the character tab in Burning Crusade).

Known Issues:
- Not all tooltips are displaying correctly
- Selected options are not saving between relog.
- Delay in stats updating if window is open when a buff is applied/removed.
